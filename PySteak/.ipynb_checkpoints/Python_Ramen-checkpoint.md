# PYTHON RAMEN

Welcome to Python Ramen! We have every kind of ramen you'd want, and we meticulously keep track of our costs and revenue behind the scenes to be sure to serve our customers as best as possible. You'd like to see how that works? Certainly, the customer is always right!


## Our Process:
* We'll give our computer the same menu you have in front of you, and the sales data we have on file. 
* Then we'll have the computer scan through the menu and grab the name, price, and production cost or each type of ramen 
* Then go through our sales data and see how many times custormers like yourself bought each type of ramen, and we'll calculate our revenue, profit, etc per item based on that count. 
* Of course we'll have to see that data ourselves, and let's make it a bit neater so we can read it easily.

Are you curious to see how this works behind the scenes? Well, all our source data and the Python code we use for calculations are right here!
